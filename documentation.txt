gp.playerWorldX -- координаты игрока относительно всего поля
gp.playerScreenX -- координаты игрока относительно экрана
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
****Bug 1****

все строки, начиная с последней последовательно должны исчезнуть, когда Player будет 
находится на расстоянии:
	x = -gp.screenWidth / 2; 

поэтому слева надо выставлять collision = true элементов: 
	gp.worldHeight - (gp.screenWidth / 2)

для того, чтобы строки не исчезали.



****Problem is solved. (Almost)****

i have the same problem, I've been trying to fix that for months now. 
Please @RyiSnow, any ideas on how to fix that? 

I have the assumption that it's a hardware problem. I gave my code as well 
as sprites and everything else to some friends of mine so that they could try
to run the game, and it seems to work fine for them. I guess if the graphics
get too heavy for your hardware the program starts having those graphic bugs. 

Since that would mean that the Java 2D Graphics compontent are too heavy for
the PC to handle I began to rewrite the game that I'm making in the LWJGL,
which is an external library that has improved rendering options to make stuff 
like these graphic issues non-existent. I didn't progress far enough to check if the 
LWGJL is actually the conclusion for this problem yet tho, so I'd love an answer from 
you Snow - You might be able to help. I really need to fix that
